Customization is at the heart of the DIY keyboard hobby. Today, we're diving into the endless possibilities that the Ergonaut One offers for making your keyboard uniquely yours. Modify, personalize, and express—let's unlock the full potential of your Ergonaut One together!

## Why Settle for Stock When You Can Mod?

Your Ergonaut One is your canvas, and the art of modding is how you paint it. With a few simple changes or even deep modifications, you can transform the feel, sound, and look of your keyboard to match your personal style.

### The Switch to Perfection

The Gateron Low Profile switches are a dream to type on, but did you know you can make them even better? From swapping springs to achieve your preferred typing weight to lubricating stems for a smoother action—it's all within your reach.

#### Top 3 Switch Mods to Try:

1. **Spring Swap**: Choose a heavier or lighter spring to customize the force needed for each keystroke.
2. **Lubrication**: Apply a thin layer of Krytox or Tribosys lube to reduce friction and create a buttery-smooth action.
3. **Filming**: Add thin films between the top and bottom housing of your switch to reduce wobble and produce a more uniform sound.

### Keycaps That Speak Volumes

Keycaps are the soul of your keyboard's aesthetic. Want a splash of color? A theme that reflects your favorite season, holiday, or aesthetic? Or perhaps you're searching for that perfect, luxurious texture under your fingertips. The Ergonaut One supports a wide range of keycaps, and the results can be stunning.

#### Popular Keycap Materials:

- **PBT**: Durable, with a textured matte finish for a premium feel.
- **ABS**: Often found in high-quality custom sets, these are perfect for vibrant colors and shine.
- **POM**: For the typist seeking a unique, thocky sound and slick typing experience.

### 3D Printing: Your Doorway to Originality

One of the groundbreaking features of the Ergonaut One is the ability to 3D print your keyboard case. This isn't just about aesthetics; it's a transformative power that allows you to tailor your Ergonaut to not only your hands but also your personality and environment. Let's explore the options and methods to create a case that's a true reflection of you.

#### Harness the Full Potential of 3D Printing:

With the provided STL files for the Ergonaut One, you can choose between the Modern or the Classic case design - or await the release of the FR4 Sandwich case. Each offers a unique flair and feel, but why stop at what's provided?

1. **Eco-Friendly Cases**: Opt for sustainable solutions without compromising on style. PLA, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane, is not only environmentally friendly but also comes in a variety of vibrant colors and effects. Imagine a wood-filled PLA case for a warm, natural touch on your desk.

2. **Durability-Boosted**: For those who bring their keyboards on every adventure, a resilient case is non-negotiable. ABS and PETG are your allies here, known for their toughness and resistance to higher temperatures. These materials can protect your Ergonaut One against the rigors of travel and intensive use, be it in a bustling office or during a field project.

3. **Flex Your Finish**: Personalize your case with a professional finish. Start with a smooth sanding process to remove any 3D printing lines. Then, prime and paint your case to match your decor or flaunt your favorite colors. Seal it off with a clear lacquer to protect your paint job and add a polished shine. You could even go the extra mile and try hydro-dipping for spectacular patterns that'll stand out in any space.

4. **Translucency and Texture**: Use clear or translucent filaments for a case that showcases the intricate workings of your keyboard. Consider printing with flexible TPU to add a shock-absorbing layer or grip to the underside of the case.

5. **Modern or Classic**: Depending on your taste, you could adhere to the sleek lines of the Modern case or the time-honored aesthetic of the Classic design. Each can be printed without the need for supports (depending on your printer's capabilities), making them beginner-friendly choices. Remember, the Modern case is the easiest to print and recommended for those new to 3D printing.

6. **A True Original**: Why not modify the existing designs? Alter the CAD files to include your name, logo, or a pattern that resonates with you. Or, design a case from scratch that fully embodies your vision. The open-source nature of the Ergonaut One means the sky's the limit when it comes to customization.

### Tips for Flawless 3D Printing:

- **Optimal Settings**: Use a layer height of 0.2mm and an extrusion width of 0.4mm for a good balance between detail and strength.
- **Adhesion Matters**: The Classic case might have built-in supports for better bed adhesion, but always ensure your print bed is properly leveled and clean for the best first layer adhesion.
- **Post-Print Cleanup**: For the Classic case, don't forget to remove any included support structures after printing for a clean finish.

### Firmware Flexing for the Power User

Tailoring your Ergonaut One goes beyond the tactile; firmware customization makes your keyboard an intuitive extension of your workflow. Current models run on the ZMK firmware—known for its wireless proficiency—allowing you to map keys, craft layers, and set up macros directly suited to your needs.

#### ZMK: Wireless Mastery at Your Fingertips

ZMK comes packed with features that cater to the modern typist. With its emphasis on low power for wireless keyboards, it's an ideal match for the Ergonaut One's design. Configure your layout via online GUIs, and take advantage of features that make your typing experience fluid and personalized.

#### Exploring QMK Terrain

While QMK is not natively supported due to the Seeeduino XIAO nRF52840's microcontroller, the open-source community continuously pushes the envelope. Enterprising individuals have managed to run QMK on other Seeeduino XIAO models making the possibility of running QMK on the Ergonaut One an exciting challenge for those looking to tinker and explore.

Firmware customization is a journey of its own. Whether you're syncing your typing to your thinking with ZMK, or ready to break new ground with QMK, your Ergonaut One is waiting to be as individual as your approach to technology.
